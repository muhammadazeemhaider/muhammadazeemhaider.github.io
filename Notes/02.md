<h2>Society of Mind</h2>

Currently reading the book, and will update as I finish the book.

<p><em>Excerpts I really liked</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    "The world," van Gogh said, "is a face  
    In which I see my soul's grimace."  
    But has reality become  
    Merely emotion's medium?  
    O universe of forms, I ask  
    Are you a mirror, or a mask?  
  </li>

  <li>
    There's something queer about describing consciousness: whatever people mean to say, they can't seem to make it clear. It's not like feeling confused or ignorant. Instead, we feel we know what's going on but can't describe it properly. How could anything seem so close, yet always keep beyond our reach?
  </li>

  <li>
    Or in the night, imagining some fear,<br>
    How easy is a bush supposed a bear.<br>
    - William Shakespeare
  </li>

  David Jensen, in his class CS 602, first introduced me to this quote by Wolfgang Pauli when talking about how hypotheses and theories should always be falsifiable. It always stuck with me, and then I read it in this book. <br>
  <li>
    That theory is worthless. It isn't even wrong! <br>
    - Wolfgang Pauli
  </li>
</ul>
