<h2>Society of Mind</h2>

Currently reading the book, and will update as I finish the book.

<p><em>Excerpts I really liked</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    "The world," van Gogh said, "is a face  
    In which I see my soul's grimace."  
    But has reality become  
    Merely emotion's medium?  
    O universe of forms, I ask  
    Are you a mirror, or a mask?  
  </li>

  <li>
    There's something queer about describing consciousness: whatever people mean to say, they can't seem to make it clear. It's not like feeling confused or ignorant. Instead, we feel we know what's going on but can't describe it properly. How could anything seem so close, yet always keep beyond our reach?
  </li>
</ul>
