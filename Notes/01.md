Excerpts I really liked

- Feynmann recalled Rabi saying, "Any virtue that a man has, even if he has many vices, should not be used as a tool against him."

- For now, knowledge was scarce and therefore dear. It was the same for scientists. The currency of scientific information had not yet been devalued by excess.

- He went up to MIT, where he could be alone, and opened a fresh notebook. On the title page he wrote: NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DONT ABOUT. For the first but not the last time he reorganized his knowledge.

- But what's the importance of that? Bethe asked. It doesn't have any importance, he said. I don't care whether a thing has importance. Isn't it fun?

- He resented more than just the hollowness of standardized knowledge. Rote learning drained away all that he valued in science: the inventive soul, the habit of seeking better ways to do anything. His kind of knowledge -- knowledge by doing -- "gives a feeling of stability and reality about the world," he said, "and drives out many fears and superstitions." He was thinking now about what science meant and what knowledge meant.

- Why, as the pool of available humans has risen from one hundred million to one billion to five billion, has the production of geniuses -- Shakespeares, Newtons, Mozarts, Einsteins -- seemingly choked off to nothing, genius itself coming to seem like the property of the past. 

- Imagination is that faculty whereby the mind not only reflects on its own operations, but which assembles the various ideas conveyed to the understanding by the canal of sensation, and treasured up in the repository of the memory, compounding or disjoining them at pleasure; and which, by its plastic power of inventing new associations of ideas, and of combining them with infinite variety, is enabled to present a creation of its own, and to exhibit scenes and objects which never existed in nature.

- "Nothing is certain. Werner Heisenberg wrote this message in the twentieth century's consciousness. The mathematician Kurt Godel followed with a famous proof that no logical system can ever be consistent and complete. The possibilities of true knowledge seemed to fade."
