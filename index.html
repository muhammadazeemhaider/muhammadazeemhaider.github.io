            <p>Hi, I'm Azeem. I am a computer scientist who enjoys researching how humans operate when it comes to language and their cognitive abilities. I graduated from Habib University in 2024 with a <strong>BS (Honors) in Computer Science</strong> and a minor in <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>.</p>
            <p>My research currently focuses on cognition and linguistics, more specifically, how visual context plays a role in the way people perceive concepts.</p>
            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My research interests lie in the domains of neuro-linguistics and computational linguistics. Specifically, I want to focus on understanding how language is structured in the brain and syntactically produced in different contexts. I am also interested in language acquisition in children raised in multilingual environments and how this upbringing influences their linguistic development. Additionally, I want to explore the syntactic degeneration in multilingual individuals caused by Broca's area aphasia.</p> 
            <p>Beyond these topics, I am intrigued by the evolving nature of online language which at times feels completely different to natural languages. As communication increasingly relies on memes and online jokes, I seek to understand the cognitive processes and reasoning behind these new forms of expression. I believe this new form of communication has the potential to reflect one's mental well-being and cognitive processes.</p>
            <p>When I am not delving into language and its underlying meanings, I enjoy creating visualizations and presenting data in a clear and compelling narrative. I have a particular interest in Bayesian statistics due to its broad applications across various fields.</p>
