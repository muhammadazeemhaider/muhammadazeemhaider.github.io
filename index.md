    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, I'm Muhammad Azeem Haider. I graduated from <a href="https://habib.edu.pk">Habib University</a> in 2024 with a <strong>BS (Honors) in Computer Science</strong> and a minor in <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>. My research interest lies in understanding the application of artificial intelligence in law, education, and healthcare - particularly in addressing language disorders such as Aphasia. Additionally, I am also interested in understanding and studying the economics of developing countries and the unique factors that hinder their economic progress.</p>

<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence and its impact on law, education, and healthcare, particularly language disorders. I am interested in working on computational solutions in the domain of natural language processing for language disorders such as Aphasia to explore potential solutions for syntactic-semantic degeneration. I am also interested in the process of language acquisition in children raised in multilingual environments and how this upbringing influences their linguistic development, which is sometimes hindered or delayed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond these topics, I am also fascinated by the evolving nature of online language, which at times feels entirely different from natural languages. As communication increasingly relies on memes and online jokes, I seek to computationally analyze and understand the cognitive processes and reasoning behind these new forms of expression, which can reflect an individual's manner of thinking and cognition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am also intrigued by the health and education economics aspects of development economics, particularly in relation to developing countries. I aim to explore how improvements in healthcare and education can directly impact a nation's economic performance. Coming from Pakistan, where both the health and education systems face significant challenges, I have observed firsthand how these deficiencies hinder economic progress. I am particularly interested in understanding how improving healthcare and education in developing countries can foster economic growth, reduce poverty, and contribute to human capital development.</p>

<h2>Active Research Projects</h2> 
<ul style="text-align: justify;"> 
  <li><strong>Composing Classical Tabla music using Evolutionary Algorithms:</strong> Designed and implemented an evolutionary algorithm to generate novel South Asian tabla compositions, optimizing rhythms with a goal-based fitness function to minimize human intervention. Evaluated compositions using domain-specific heuristics and expert feedback.</li> 
  <li><strong>Gendered Impact of Locust Swarms in Ethiopia:</strong> This research investigates the socio-economic impact of locust swarms in Ethiopia, focusing on gender differences. The study employs a difference-in-differences approach to analyze the effects.</li>
