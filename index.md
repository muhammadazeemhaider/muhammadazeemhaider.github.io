    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, I'm Azeem. I am a computer scientist with a passion for understanding how humans process language and how developing economies function. I graduated from Habib University in 2024 with a <strong>BS (Honors) in Computer Science</strong> and a minor in <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>. My current research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence in healthcare, particularly in addressing language disorders. I also have a deep interest in studying the economics of developing countries and the factors that hinder their progress.</p>

<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My research interests lie in the domain of computational linguistics and its impact on healthcare, particularly language disorders. I am interested in the process of language acquisition in children raised in multilingual environments and how this upbringing influences their linguistic development, which is sometimes hindered or delayed. Additionally, I want to explore syntactic degeneration in individuals caused by language disorders.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond these topics, I am fascinated by the evolving nature of online language, which at times feels completely different from natural languages. As communication increasingly relies on memes and online jokes, I seek to understand the cognitive processes and reasoning behind these new forms of expression, which can reflect an individual's manner of thinking and cognition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am also intrigued by the health and education economics aspects of development economics, particularly in relation to developing countries. I aim to explore how improvements in healthcare and education can directly impact a nation's economic performance. Coming from Pakistan, where both the health and education systems face significant challenges, I have observed firsthand how these deficiencies hinder economic progress. I am particularly interested in understanding how improving healthcare and education in developing countries can foster economic growth, reduce poverty, and contribute to human capital development.</p>
