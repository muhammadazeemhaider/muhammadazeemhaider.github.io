    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, I'm Muhammad Azeem Haider. I graduated from <a href="https://habib.edu.pk">Habib University</a> in 2024 with a <strong>BS (Honors) in Computer Science</strong> and a minor in <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>. My research interest lies in understanding the application of artificial intelligence in law, education, and healthcare - particularly in addressing language disorders such as Aphasia. Additionally, I am also interested in understanding and studying the economics of developing countries and the unique factors that hinder their economic progress.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a  href="https://reonenergy.com/">Reon Energy Limited</a>, where I work on developing analytical NLP solutions for the company's Energy Management System called SPARK. I am currently working on  building natural language interfaces that convert user queries into SQL to retrieve and present relevant data from relational databases.</p>

<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am passionate about exploring Artificial Intelligence's impact on law, education, and healthcare, focusing on language disorders. My research centers on developing computational natural language processing solutions for conditions like Aphasia to address syntactic and semantic degeneration. Additionaly, I am also interested in studying first language acquisition in children growing up in multilingual households, examining how diverse linguistic environments shape their development, including cases where this multilingual context may contribute to temporary hindrances or delays.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond these topics, I am also fascinated by the evolving nature of online language, which at times feels entirely different from natural languages. As communication increasingly relies on memes and online jokes, I seek to computationally analyze and understand the cognitive processes and reasoning behind these new forms of expression, which can reflect an individual's manner of thinking and cognition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am also intrigued by the health and education economics aspects of development economics, particularly in relation to developing countries. I aim to explore how improvements in healthcare and education can directly impact a nation's economic performance. Coming from Pakistan, where both the health and education systems face significant challenges, I have observed firsthand how these deficiencies hinder economic progress. I am particularly interested in understanding how improving healthcare and education in developing countries can foster economic growth, reduce poverty, and contribute to human capital development.</p>

<h2>Active Research Projects</h2> 
<ul style="text-align: justify;"> 
  <li><strong>Composing Classical Tabla music using Evolutionary Algorithms:</strong> Designed and implemented an evolutionary algorithm to generate novel South Asian tabla compositions, optimizing rhythms with a goal-based fitness function to minimize human intervention. Evaluated compositions using domain-specific heuristics and expert feedback.</li> 
  <li><strong>Gendered Impact of Locust Swarms in Ethiopia:</strong> This research investigates the socio-economic impact of locust swarms in Ethiopia, focusing on gender differences. The study employs a difference-in-differences approach to analyze the effects.</li>
