    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, I'm Muhammad Azeem Haider. I am a graduate student at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/"> Manning College for Information and Computer Science</a> at University of Massachusetts Amherst. Previously, I graduated from <a href="https://habib.edu.pk">Habib University</a> in 2024 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering. After graduation, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer in the telecommunications industry, where I worked on developing analytical NLP solutions for internal and external stakeholders.
    <br> <br>
    I am fascinated by how the brain works and want to understand how it functions the way it does, as well as how we might replicate the language and cognitive abilities in language models that come so naturally to humans. I am also interested in working with retrieval systems, understanding how retrieval can be improved within generative pipelines, and exploring how sparse retrieval methods can be made more effective and efficient as standalone systems. </p>

<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am passionate about exploring Artificial Intelligence's impact on law, education, and healthcare, focusing on language disorders. My research centers on developing computational natural language processing solutions for conditions like Aphasia to address syntactic and semantic degeneration. Additionaly, I am also interested in studying first language acquisition in children growing up in multilingual households, examining how diverse linguistic environments shape their development, including cases where this multilingual context may contribute to temporary hindrances or delays.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond these topics, I am also fascinated by the evolving nature of online language, which at times feels entirely different from natural languages. As communication increasingly relies on memes and online jokes, I seek to computationally analyze and understand the cognitive processes and reasoning behind these new forms of expression, which can reflect an individual's manner of thinking and cognition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am also intrigued by the health and education economics aspects of development economics, particularly in relation to developing countries. I aim to explore how improvements in healthcare and education can directly impact a nation's economic performance. Coming from Pakistan, where both the health and education systems face significant challenges, I have observed firsthand how these deficiencies hinder economic progress. I am particularly interested in understanding how improving healthcare and education in developing countries can foster economic growth, reduce poverty, and contribute to human capital development.</p> -->
